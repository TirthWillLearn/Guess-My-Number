## About Project 
"Guess My Number" is an engaging web-based game designed to challenge players to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20. The interface is user-friendly and divided into two main sections. On the left, players input their guesses, and on the right, the game status is displayed, including messages, score, and high score. The header features the game title and a button to reset the game, offering a seamless user experience.

The project is structured using HTML, providing a clear and semantic layout. The HTML file includes essential elements such as the game title, input fields, buttons, and sections for displaying messages and scores. The CSS file enhances the visual appeal by importing a Google font for a retro-inspired look and defining styles for various elements. The design features a dark background with bright, contrasting text and elements, improving visibility and creating an engaging user experience. Key elements, such as the header, main content areas, buttons, and input fields, are styled to maintain consistency and aesthetics.

The JavaScript file is the backbone of the game, containing the logic for generating the random number, handling user inputs, updating the score, and providing feedback messages. When a player makes a guess, the game compares it to the generated number and updates the message to indicate whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. Each incorrect guess decreases the score, and the game tracks the highest score achieved during the session, adding a competitive edge.

"Guess My Number" is a simple yet captivating project that demonstrates fundamental web development skills, including HTML structuring, CSS styling, and JavaScript programming. It offers an interactive experience while reinforcing key concepts of front-end development. This project serves as a practical exercise in building dynamic web applications and provides a solid foundation for further exploration into more complex projects. It showcases the ability to create engaging and functional web applications that prioritize user experience and interactivity.
